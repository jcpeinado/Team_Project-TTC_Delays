As part of the Data Science Certificate program at the University of Toronto’s Data Sciences Institute, our capstone project focuses on analyzing TTC Subway Delay Data from 2024 and 2025. Combining advanced data science methodologies with our analytical expertise, we aim to solve a critical operational challenge: accurately classifying subway delay risks to enhance decision-making and operational effectiveness.
The central goal of this project is to build a predictive model that classifies delay risks at specific stations (Station X) and subway lines (Line Y) into two categories—Low or High—by evaluating factors such as the month (season), day, and rush-hour timing.

Project Objectives
•	Develop a predictive classification model to determine subway delay risks.
•	Analyze historical subway delay data to identify key factors influencing delays.
•	Evaluate model accuracy and effectiveness in predicting delay risks.
•	Provide actionable insights to stakeholders to support informed decision-making and operational improvements.
•	Recommend strategies for real-time communication and operational adjustments based on model predictions.
Business Question
•	Classification Problem: Based on available TTC delay data, can we accurately predict and classify the risk level (Low or High) of delays at given stations and subway lines, considering seasonal patterns, specific days, and peak commuting hours?
