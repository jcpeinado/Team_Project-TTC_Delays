## Requirements

## Introduction

As part of the Data Science Certificate program at the University of Toronto’s Data Sciences Institute, our capstone project is dedicated to enhancing Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) subway operations through data-driven insights. Leveraging advanced data science methodologies, we aim to address a critical operational challenge: accurately classifying subway delay risks to support proactive decision-making and improve service reliability.
This project focuses on analyzing TTC Subway Delay Data from 2024 and 2025 to develop a predictive model that classifies delay risks at specific stations (Station X) and subway lines (Line Y) into two categories—Low or High—by evaluating key influencing factors such as the month (season), day, and rush-hour timing.

## Objectives

The objectives of the project are outlined below:
•	Design and implement an intelligent classification model to assess subway delay risks in real-time.
•	Investigate historical trends in subway delays to uncover the most influential contributing factors.
•	Develop a user-friendly framework that translates model predictions into actionable insights for transit decision-makers.
•	Propose innovative strategies for dynamic communication, ensuring passengers and transit staff receive timely and relevant updates.

Business Question
Classification Problem: Can we accurately predict and classify the risk level (Low or High) of subway delays at specific stations and lines based on available TTC delay data, considering seasonal trends, specific days, and peak commuting hours?
