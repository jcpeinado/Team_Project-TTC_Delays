## Methodology
### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis

**Load the Dataset:**  
We imported the data (from a CSV file) into a pandas DataFrame. [`01_exploratory_data_analysis.csv`](/01_exploratory_data_analysis/01_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb)  

**Initial Investigation:**
- We inspected the dimensions of the dataset; the raw DataFrame had a shape of (28,571 rows × 10 columns).  
  ![Infor_df](img/01_exploratory_data/02_info_df.jpg)
- We displayed the first few rows to understand the format and general structure. In this step, we identified our target variable: `Min Delay`, and our categorical features: [`Date`, `Time`, `Code`, `Bound`, `Line`, `Vehicle`].

**Descriptive Statistics:**
- We calculated summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) to gain insight into the distribution of each variable.  
  ![Summary_01](img/01_exploratory_data/01_DP.jpg)
- We looked for anomalies. In our case, `Min Delay` contains outliers (e.g., 700 minutes), while 75% of observations range between 1 and 18 minutes.  
  ![Boxplot_MinDelay](img/01_exploratory_data/03_MinDelay_boxplot.png)

**Visual Explorations:**

- **Potential Correlation in Min Gap and Min Delay**  
  ![Heat_Map](img/01_exploratory_data/04_matrix.png)  
  ![Scatter](img/01_exploratory_data/05_scatter.png)

**Key Observations:**  
- **Correlation in Min Gap and Min Delay:** There is a strong correlation between these two features.  
- **Codes:** The delay codes will be grouped into a `category` column to help classify the delays.  
- **Missing Values:** Missing values will be handled in the Data Cleaning section.  
- **Feature with Low Importance:** The categorical feature `Vehicle` has low importance for our analysis.  
- **SRT Line:** The SRT line is out of scope because it is not in service.  
- **Note:** Only data from 2024 and 2025 was considered for this project.

###     2. Understanding the raw data


| Feature       | Description                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `Min Delay`  | The delay in minutes for each train.            |
| `Date`       | The date when the delay occurred.               |
| `Time`       | The time of the delay event.                    |

###     3. Data Cleaning and Processing

Data Cleaning for the Team Project TTC Delay

This code prepares the data for analysis by merging datasets for period Jan, 01, 2024 to Jan 31, 2025, cleaning up unnecessary columns, and standardizing date formats. It sets the foundation for further exploration and visualization of TTC subway delays.
The  the result for years 2024 and 2025 datasets are concatenated into a single DataFrame named 'df_delay.csv' and saved at directory  '../data/processed_data/df_delay.csv'.

Files Used:
1. ttc-subway-delay-data-2024.csv:
 - this file contains TTC subway delay data for the year 2024.
 - it is loaded into a DataFrame named df_2024 using pd.read_csv().

2. TTC Subway Delay Data since 2025.csv:
 - this file contains TTC subway delay data for month of January of 2025.

3. code_category_description.csv 
- file to categorize various delay codes related to transportation operations

###     4. Model Training and Development

The model is trained with Logistic regression model.
The  testcase saved at directory   '../02_data_processing/02_model_training.ipynb'.

###     5. Model Selection


**1. Binary Classification Focus**  
The primary aim of the model is to determine whether a particular outcome (e.g., delay vs. no delay) will occur. Logistic Regression is specifically designed for binary classification, mapping inputs to a probability between 0 and 1. As such, it aligns well with scenarios where the dependent variable is a yes/no or true/false type of outcome.

**2. Suitability for Categorical Predictors**  
A significant portion of the dataset consists of categorical variables. Logistic Regression readily handles categorical data through encoding techniques such as one-hot encoding. This approach permits the model to learn how each category influences the log-odds of the target outcome. Furthermore, the model’s observed accuracy suggests that the chosen encoding and feature preparation steps effectively leverage the categorical information.

**3. Model Interpretability**  
Unlike certain more complex methods (e.g., neural networks or ensemble models), Logistic Regression offers transparent coefficients indicating the contribution of each feature (or category) to the probability of the outcome. This characteristic supports clearer communication of model results to non-technical stakeholders, fostering trust and understanding in how decisions are reached.

**4. Computational Efficiency**  
Compared to other classification algorithms, Logistic Regression is relatively fast to train and update. This efficiency is particularly beneficial for projects that require frequent re-training or real-time analytics, as it reduces both computational overhead and latency during predictive operations.

**5. Probability Outputs**  
Logistic Regression natively produces probability estimates, which facilitate a granular understanding of the model’s confidence in each classification. This feature also allows practitioners to adjust the classification threshold as needed, depending on the balance of priorities, such as sensitivity vs. specificity.

**6. Resilience to Data Imperfections**  
When combined with regularization, Logistic Regression can handle moderate levels of noise and outliers. The model’s performance indicates that any violations of assumptions (e.g., perfect linear separability) are not severe enough to impede accuracy, affirming its suitability within the current data context.


**Conclusion**  
Given the project’s focus on a binary outcome, the presence of numerous categorical features, and the need for both interpretability and computational efficiency, Logistic Regression emerges as a strong methodological choice. The decent accuracy achieved further validates its effectiveness for this classification task.

The model is trained with Logistic regression model.

Create a model pipeline - steps to perform:
* Split the dataset into training and testing subsets 
* Defining transformations for numeric features
* Defining transformations for categorical features
* Add a step labelled 'preprocessor' and assign the ColumnTransformer from the previous section.
* Import the Logistic Regression model from scikit-learn
* Initialize the Logistic Regression model with a random state for reproducibility
* Calculate the accuracy of the model on the test dataset
* Visualize the importance of the model features

## Results

After the processing according to results based on testing set the model correctly classified approximately as 61.20% of the instances in the test set.
The analysis of feature importance from the model highlights several key factors that significantly contribute to TTC delays. Each of these factors is discussed below to provide insights into their influence:

[Model_Results](/img/02_results/03_model_features.png)

 - Min Gap
 - Bound
 - Line
 - Category of incident
 - Day if the week
 - Month 

* Min Gap: The "Min Gap" feature reflects the interval between consecutive trains. A smaller or irregular gap can lead to congestion on the line, increasing the likelihood of delays. This variable’s high importance suggests that maintaining consistent train intervals is critical for mitigating delays and ensuring smooth operations.

* The Cagetgories having the max impact of TTS dealay are:
- Doors/Passengers/Platform Incidents
- Medical Injuries/Safety
- Safety/Policing
- Infracstructure/Debries
The delays realted to those categories causing service interruptions during the process

* Line 'SHP' (Sheppard) - identified as the most impacted by delays. This could be attributed to the line's operational characteristics, such as fewer trains or limited infrastructure capacity, making it more sensitive to disruptions.

* Day of the Week - Saturday: The model identified Saturdays as a key day for increased delays. This trend may be attributed to higher maintenance works done during weekends, coupled with a reduced service schedule, making the system more susceptible to disruptions.

* Month - July: The month of July stands out as a period with heightened delays. This could be due to seasonal factors, such as increased tourism or special events, which elevate passenger volumes. Additionally, weather conditions such as summer storms may impact service reliability during this time.

* Based on the Paretto Chart and wroking with the clean data, we could identify the categories that causes the 80% of our delays.

![Paretto](/img/02_results/01_80-20.png)

The 80% of the delays are caused by:

- Security/Policing Issues
- Door/Passenger/Platform Incidents
- Signaling/Communication/Power
- Medical/Injury/Safety
- Transportation/Operator

* Top 10 Dealy Average in min by Station

* Top 10 Delay Average in min by Category

![Delay_by_Categ_Mean](/img/02_results/03_mean_delay_cat.png)

* Top 10 Delay Average in min by Month

![Delay_by_Categ_Mean](/img/02_results/05_mean_delay_by_month.png)

* There is a strong linear regression correlation between the Delay and the Gap numeric variables

[LR_Delay_Gap](/img/02_results/04_linear_regression_correlation.jpg)


**Conclusion:**
The findings underscore the multifaceted nature of TTC delays, influenced by operational, behavioral, and temporal factors. To address these issues, targeted strategies such as improving passenger education, optimizing train schedules, and enhancing track and platform maintenance can be implemented. Recognizing the prominence of specific days and months in contributing to delays also enables more efficient allocation of resources to manage anticipated disruptions.
