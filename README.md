## Methodology
With the purpose of achiving our objecting we have developed the following methodology:
###     1. Exploratory Data Analysis

In this section, we:

**Load the Dataset:**  
Import the data (e.g., from a CSV) into a pandas DataFrame.

**Initial Investigation:**
- Inspect the dimensions of the data in our raw data frame we had a size of (28571, 10).
- Display the first few rows to understand the format and general structure. In this step we could identify ouer target variable: `Min Delay` and our categorical features [`Date`, `Time`, `Code`, `Bound`, `Line`, `Vehicle`]

**Descriptive Statistics:**
- Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) to get a sense of the variable distributions.

- Look for anomalies (e.g., extremely high or low values) that might hint at data errors.

**Visual Explorations:**
Generate plots such as histograms, box plots, or density plots to observe the distribution of numerical variables.
Create scatter plots or correlation heatmaps to identify relationships between variables.
Look for distinct patterns or trends that could inform subsequent cleaning or modeling steps.
Key Observations:
Identify any patterns in the data—such as skewed distributions, clusters of points, or outlier values—that warrant further investigation or special treatment in later steps.
